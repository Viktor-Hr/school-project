        <h2> Training Regimen</h2>
    <div class="week-grid">
  
      <div class="day"  data-desc=" Focus on low‐angle and overhang problems in the bouldering cave to dial in footwork and body positioning. 
    Spend 20–30 minutes warming up with easy traverses, then work on 3–4 project problems at your limit, 
    paying close attention to beta (the sequence of moves). Finish with a cool‐down stretch and 10 minutes of core activation (planks, hollow holds)"><strong>Mon</strong><br>Bouldering + Technique</div>
  <div class="day" data-desc="After a light warm‐up, climb a few easy routes to get blood flowing, then move to the fingerboard. 
    Perform 5–6 sets of hangs on varying edge sizes (start at larger crimps, work down to smaller ones), 
    using a 7 sec hang / 3 sec rest protocol. Finish with a circuit of leg raises, Russian twists, and L‐sit holds to build a rock‐solid core.
 "><strong>Tue</strong><br>Fingerboard + Core</div>
  <div class="day" data-desc=" Dedicate 45–60 minutes to a yoga flow that emphasizes hip openers, shoulder mobility, and spinal twists. 
    Poses like pigeon, thread‑the‑needle, and downward dog help relieve tendon stress and improve balance. 
    End with foam rolling (quads, forearms, calves) and deep diaphragmatic breathing to accelerate recovery.
"><strong>Wed</strong><br>Yoga or Rest</div>
  <div class="day" data-desc=" Head to the top‐rope wall for laps on moderate routes (5.10a–5.11b range). 
    Aim for continuous climbing for 20 minutes straight—down‐climb or rappel back to the ground and go again. 
    Keep your rest periods short (30–60 sec) to train lactic‐acid tolerance. Finish with 2–3 easy traverses to cool down.
 "><strong>Thu</strong><br>Endurance Climbing</div>
  <div class="day" data-desc=" Warm up thoroughly on the campus board with 2×5 ladder runs on jumbo rungs. 
    Progress to 3–4 max‐reach moves, touching as many rungs above as you can. 
    After campus, do 3–4 sets of dynamic pull‐ups (chest to bar or clap pull‑ups) and finish with explosive push‑ups to balance your upper body strength.
  "><strong>Fri</strong><br>Campus Board + Power</div>
  <div class="day" data-desc=" Translate your indoor gains to real rock. Pick 2–3 sport routes or boulder problems outdoors—one warm‑up, one to project at your limit, and one cool‑down. 
    Practice reading the rock’s features and managing exposure. Top it off with a short hike or approach run for extra endurance.
 "><strong>Sat</strong><br>Outdoor Climbing</div>
  <div class="day"  data-desc="  Keep it light: 30–45 minutes of easy swimming, cycling, or a brisk walk to promote circulation. 
    Spend 10–15 minutes stretching major muscle groups, then use a foam roller on tight spots (forearms, calves, lats). 
    Finish with 5–10 minutes of mindfulness or guided meditation to reset mentally for the week ahead.

        <h2> Climbing Diet </h2>
    <div class="food-grid">
      <div class="food" scdata-desc=" Aim for 1.2–1.6 g of protein per kg of body weight each day.  
    Quality sources like eggs, tofu, chicken breast, and Greek yogurt help repair muscle fibers torn during intense climbing sessions.
 "><strong>Protein</strong><br>Eggs, tofu, chicken, Greek yogurt</div>
  <div class="food" scdata-desc=" Carbs are your primary fuel. Include whole‐grain oats, sweet potatoes, fruits (bananas, berries), and quinoa  
    to sustain energy on long climbs and aid glycogen replenishment post‑workout.
 "><strong>Carbs</strong><br>Oats, sweet potatoes, fruits, quinoa</div>
  <div class="food" scdata-desc=" Don’t shy away from fats—nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil support hormone balance and joint health.  
    They also slow digestion, giving you steady energy over several hours.
 "><strong>Fats</strong><br>Nuts, avocados, olive oil</div>
  <div class="food" scdata-desc="Quick bites like trail mix (nuts + dried fruit), fresh bananas, or a quality protein bar  
    keep blood sugar stable between meals and prevent energy crashes mid‑climb.
  "><strong>Snacks</strong><br>Trail mix, bananas, protein bars</div>
  <div class="food" scdata-desc=" Drink at least 2–3 L of water daily, more when you’re sweating heavily.  
    Add electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium) via sports drinks or natural sources (coconut water, salted nuts)  
    to prevent cramps and maintain muscle function.
